# ROUTING CONFIGURATION
#
# This is the routing file where you will put your personalized routing. The
# application normally routes the user to /controller/method/args[/args...].
# Every single line that begins with "#" is ignored (is a comment).
#
# With this file you can set custom routes with the following syntax:
#   new/path!routes/to/this/path
#
# If you want to use regex in your url parameters, you can do it putting the
# regex code between curly braces ( "{regexCode}" ). Example:
#   {\d+}!posts/id
#
# If JSON API mode is turned on and the url is /api/something this file will
# be ignored by default. Change it in your config.php file.
