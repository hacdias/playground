# Notes to Hugo

This is just a small package I built to convert my markdown Notes to a Hugo friendly format, including backlinks and some other information. It was used to build my digital garden at [notes.hacdias.com](../../websites/hacdias-notes/). Note that this package is really tailored for my use case.

## Install

```
go install github.com/hacdias/playground/go/notes-to-hugo
```

## Usage

```
notes-to-hugo --input <notes-directory> --output <hugo-site-directory>
```
