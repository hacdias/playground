- **Convergence**: multiple inputs come together to synapse on a single neuron.
- **Divergence**: signal diverges to many places of the body.
- **Recurrance**: different recurrent patterns, in conjunction with convergence and divergence can create complex patterns. E.g.: Central Pattern Generators (CPG): rhythmic movements on fish's tail.
