## GPS Data

- How to visualize?
- Heat map?
- Draw lines based on where I was?

- I'm using Compass right now to track my location, as well as using Swarm to mark the places where I've been. Is it worth to use both tools? I guess it depends on the end goal.

## Swarm

- ~~Setup automatic collector.~~
- Make visualization page like /books.
- Generate map with places Iâ€™ve been to.
- See https://vega.github.io/vega/

## Trakt
