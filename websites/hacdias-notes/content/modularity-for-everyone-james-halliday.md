So this talk was about modularity and how great it would be if we all created smaller modules for specific functions. Here's some key aspects:

- Modules allow to reuse code easily.
- NPM modules can be used in both browser and node environments.

He also talked about using NPM for modules of basically every language. It would be interesting if that happened, but for that to happen, a lot would need to change.
