This documentary raises a lot of questions, as well as some information really interesting that I've never thought about:

- Problem: how to explain to people?
- Doesn't need trust in central authorities/banks
- Where's the money? The actual money? Actual banks don't have the money they say they have. The money we use is actually "virtual".
