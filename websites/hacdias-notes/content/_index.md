title: About these notes
---

Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I'm [Henrique](https://hacdias.com) and this is my collection of notes I've been taking, a place where I process what I learn and some of my thoughts. Please note that this notes are made by me, for me so some might not even be in English. If you see something you disagree with, want to discuss or is wrong, feel free to [send me a message](https://hacdias.com/contact). I will appreciate.

As per my setup, it's quite simple. Currently, I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write my notes on my laptop and [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) on mobile. I wrote a simple [script](https://github.com/hacdias/notes-to-hugo) that my computer runs from time to time to sync my source notes with this website.

I invite you to look at [this curated list](https://github.com/KasperZutterman/Second-Brain) of other "second brains" or "digital gardens" as you might want to call them! Let your ideas grow ðŸŒ¿
