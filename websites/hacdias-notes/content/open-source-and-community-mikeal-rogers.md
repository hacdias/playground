Due to the name of this talk, I was thinking Mikeal was going to talk more about the community itself, good parts, bad parts, issues and solutions, but he didn't. He talked about the Node.js community and the topics were kind of random in my opinion: from the **streams** and the fact that Node implemented quite a good interface to cryptocurrency and other. He also mentioned GitHub and the fact that open sourcing was much harder before it.
