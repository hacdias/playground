- Distributed "database"
- No central authority
- Transparent
- Chain of blocks
- Each block has
  - Previous block hash
  - Hash
  - Data
- Distributed ledger

## why do we need blockchain

## Applications

- Digital Identity
- Cryptocurrencies
- Intellectual Property / Notary
  - stampd.io
- Voting (?)
- Smart contracts!

### Cryptocurrencies

- Removes trust from an entity
- Mathematically correct
- (Almost) impossible to fraud
- Transparent

### Content Ownership / Copyright

## Proof-of-Work vs Proof-of-Stake

- TODO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3EFi_POhps
- TODO Proof-of-replication ? https://filecoin.io/proof-of-replication.pdf
- TODO Powerful fault tolerance: https://filecoin.io/power-fault-tolerance.pdf

## Problems

- Too much power usage
- All nodes need to verify transactions --> slow as the slowest node

## Proof of Work (PoW)

For example adding a random number to the end of the message that makes the hash function output 30 zeros in the beginning. That requires a lot of computational work to find out but it is easily verifiable.
