## C1 & Part I: Notion, Areas, History, Future
These are introductory chapters and mostly talk about the reasons why this book was written and what are peer-to-peer systems about, as well as some history and application areas.

Main requirements for future Internet-based apps:
- Scalability
- Security and reliability
- Flexibility and quality of service

Decentralized resources:
- Data is addressed by the data itself, not by location
- Note: people usually associate [P2P](/p2p/) with file-sharing but there's a lot possibilities than that: distributed computations, verifiable elections, blockchains...

## Part II: Unstructured Systems
- Page 36: good table comparing different categories of P2P systems
- Explains how some early p2p systems worked:
	-  [Gnutella](/gnutella/)
	-  [Napster](/napster/)

Definition of [P2P](/p2p/) system:

> A Peer-to-Peer system consists of computing elements that are:
> 1. connected by a network,
> 2. addressable in a unique way, and
> 3. share a common commmunication protocol.
> 
> All computing elements, synonymously called nodes or peers, have comparable roles and share responsability and costs for resources.

Conditions to make P2P infrastructure useful:
1. Decentrality
2. Structure
3. Reliability despite Dynamic change
4. Scalability

Network models:
- Random graph model
	- Easy to simulate
- Small-world networks
	- High clustering of nodes
	- Good way to structure nodes with similar interests
- Scale-free networks
	- Good [Fault Tolerance](/fault-tolerance/)
	- More vulnerable to attacks
