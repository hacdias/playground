> Neuropeptides form a large family of neuromodulators. They are generated through the cleavage of larger proteins. Neuropeptides are usually 5-20 amino acids long, which is small for a peptide, but very large for a neuromodulator. As you learn more about neuropeptides, try to answer these questions:
