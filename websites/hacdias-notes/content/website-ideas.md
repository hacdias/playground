## Ideas

- Keep IPFS and my website in sync (right now updates at least once a day)
- Use IPFS instead of BunnyCDN for larger file storage.
- Serve my blog over `dat://`
- Add schema.org
- Automatic blogroll from Aperture
- Import my.flightradar24.com and create some visualisation tool.

- Should I add date [above the posts](https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2019/11/dates-above/)? My main problem with this is information scattering. I didn't want to have the tags separated from the date and category. On the other hand, it may be useful to have the category and date in the beginning.
