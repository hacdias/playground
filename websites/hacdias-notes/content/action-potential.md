An **action potential** happens when the membrane potential of a specific neuron rapidly rises and falls.

![Action Potential](/attachments/action-potential.svg)

There are two **refractory periods**:

- **Absolute refractory period (ARP)**, when sodium voltage-gated channels become inactivated, they cannot be immediately opened again.
- **Relative refractory period (RRP)**: both sodium and potassium channels are open. Requires a stronger than usual stimulus to start a new action potential.

The action potential can be described in multiple phases.

- **Resting phase**
  - Membrane potential of  -64 mV
  - Voltage-gated $\ce{Na+}$ and $\ce{K+}$ channels closed
  - $\ce{Na+}$ and $\ce{K+}$ conductance is low
- **Rising phase**
  - Membrane potential rises after threshold is reached
  - Voltage-gated $\ce{Na+}$ channels are quick to open
  - $\ce{Na+}$ conductance is high
  - $\ce{Na+}$ flows into the cell
  - $\ce{K+}$ channels are slow to open
  - $\ce{K+}$ conductance remains low
- **Falling phase**
  - Membrane potential falls
  - Voltage-gated $\ce{K+}$ channels are opened
  - $\ce{K+}$ conductance is high
  - $\ce{K+}$ flows out of the cell
  - Voltage-gated $\ce{Na+}$ channels become inactivated
  - $\ce{Na+}$ conductance drops
  - Flow of $\ce{Na+}$ into the cell stops
- **Undershot phase**
  - Membrane potential becomes more negative than at rest
  - Voltage-gated $\ce{K+}$ channels begin to close
  - $\ce{K+}$ conductance falls
  - Flow of $\ce{K+}$ out of the cell begins to stop
  - Voltage gated $\ce{Na+}$ remain inactivated
  - $\ce{Na+}$ conductance is low
- **Recovery**
  - Voltage-gated $\ce{Na+}$ and $\ce{K+}$ channels are closed
  - $\ce{Na+}$ inactivation gate opens
  - $\ce{Na+}$ and $\ce{K+}$ conductance are low
  - Membrane potential gradually returns to baseline
