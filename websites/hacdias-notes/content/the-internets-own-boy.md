This is a movie about **Aaron Swartz**, who believed the world knowledge should be free and publicly accessibly by everyone.

- He was the co-founder of Reddit and many other orgs.
- He was greatly involved on trying to avoid SOPA law to pass. Succeeds.
- Downloaded tons of papers and research from a website using MIT's network
- The US government had a big case against him but they didn't provide information/evidence. It didn't make sense...
- It's a really big loss. He just wanted to make the world a better place.
