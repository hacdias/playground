> Learning is the foundation of success in nearly every aspect of life.

## Key Learnings

- Turn learning into projects:
  1. Plan them!
  2. Set constraints (limits) on what to learn;
  3. Set aside enough time, make a schedule;
  4. Limit materials/resources and methods.
- Train focus and productivity:
  1. Eliminate distractions;
  2. Make a schedule;
  3. Progressively increase the focused amount of time.
- Learn actively, do exercises, relate to other subjects (holistic learning).
- Quicker, deeper and more accurate feedback cycles:
  1. See the solution after each exercise;
  2. Do the harder exercises first. Be deeper;
  3. Use more accurate resources and avoid repeating errors.
- Space out learning time:
  1. Frequently review things I've learned;
  2. Don't study too much time in a row.
- Process deeply to retain more: 
  1. Summarize;
  2. Paraphrase;
  3. Simplify.
- Overlearning: learn beyond what's necessary to master a skill to get better at it.
- Watch educational video at a 1.5x-2x the speed and practice afterwards.
- Use the Feynman Technique to learn difficult concepts:
  1. Choose the concept;
  2. Write an explanation as if it was for someone who doesn't know anything about the subject;
  3. If I get stuck, get back to the books/resources and read;
  4. Simplify and make analogies.

## Where to apply

- Use it on school to spend less time with each subject; be effective;
- Career;
- Programming;
- Every aspect of life which needs learning something!
