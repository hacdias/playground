**Protocol Buffers (protobuf)** are an [Interface Description Language](/interface-description-language/) used to describe messages and operations. Some of its features:

- Allows to extend and modify the schemes, keeping backwards compatibility.
- It's a canonic format.
- The data presentation has an explicit structure.
- Can be used in a lot of programming languages.
- Efficient serialization in binary format
- The messages are concatenated in the same order as defined in the `.proto` file.
