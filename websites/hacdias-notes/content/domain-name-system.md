The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is a decentralized [Naming System](/naming-system/) for machines in a network. It's an [Application Layer](/application-layer/) protocol.

- Namespace: hierarchical and homogenous
- There are global and local names.
  - Global: FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Names), e.g., ipfs.io
  - Local: e.g., localhost
- Each context is called a domain
- Each domain is managed by an authority
- Impure names
- Recursive and iterative resolution.
