**Neural Plasticity** refers to the ability of a neural circuit to be shaped by experience. It happens all the time.

There is:

- **Short time plasticity**: acts on a timescale of milliseconds to minutes.
  - Synaptic facilitation: strengthening of synaptic connections.
  - Synaptic depression
- **Long time plasticity**: acts on a timescale of hours or more.
  - Long-term potentiation (LTP)
    - More neurotransmitters released
    - Increase number of receptors post synaptic
    - Make the postsynaptic receptors produce a larger effect
    - Hebbian or non-Hebbian
      - Non-hebbian
        - anti-hebbian-ltp, synapse weaks whe together
      - NMDAReceptor is hebbian
  - Long-term depression (LTD)
    - Hippocampus
      - related to glutamate
      - persistent weak synaptic stimulation
    - cerebellum
      - strong synaptic stimulation
- **Hebb's Rule**: cells that fire together, wire together. Neurons out of sync, lose their link.
- Associative Learning:
- Spike timing dependent plasticity
- Non-synaptic plasticity: not locally restricted to synapses. emerging field. modifications of ion channels.
