There are different types of receptors:

- **Ionotropic receptors**: protein complexes that direct the coupling of the neurotransmitter receptor to an ion channel.
- **Metabotropic receptors**: when activated, leads to the activation of a secondary mechanism inside the cell.
  - Most common are **G-protein-couple receptors (GPCRs)**
    - There are over 2 000 GPCR genes in the human genome (~10% of all genes)
    - Transmembrane protein complex
    - Alpha, beta and gamma proteins (g-proteins) due to GTP
    - Versatile

## Glutamate Receptors

**Glutamate** is the main excitatory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system. Used in more than 90% of a human brain's synaptic connections.

There are two different ionotropic glutamate receptors:

- **AMPA**: fast excitatory postsynaptic receptors; promiscuous, i.e., permeable to all cations; ligand.
- **NMDA**: LTP; binds to NMDA receptors; used inn the learning and memory functions of the brain (synaptic plasticity); ligand and voltage-gated; they need AMPA receptors to open up.
  - LTP
  - Let's Cations pass through it (calcium mostly)
  - when at rest, receives mg+
  - when depolarized, repels mg+
  - AMPA open NMDA membranes

## Glycine Receptors

- **Ionotropic**.
- **Strychnine** is a powerful antagonist of the glycine receptor.
