This talk is mainly about how to work and do open source. Some key aspects Charlie mentioned:

- You need to market your work because open source doesn't market itself.
- Pay attention to people around you.
- Don't take too much time to respond to an issue or PR. People feel ignored.
- **Communication** is key.
- Don't be mean.
- Only do open source if you **really like it** and have time to spend to care.
- Your team should be like a **distributed graph structure.**
