An **Interface Description Language (IDL)** is a specification language that:

- is a declarative language
- does not describe the implementation
- allows for procedures written in a language to be executed by another language
- allows to define data types
- allows to define function prototypes

It is commonly used with [Remote Procedure Call](/remote-procedure-call/).
