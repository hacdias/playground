On this talk by the creator on NPM, Isaac Schlueter, he focus on the leadership in the open source communities. Some key points:

- Being **persistent** is important.
- Great leaders come up through natural growth and communication with community.
- If something goes wrong:
    - think about what to do in the future to avoid the same problem; and
    - **own** and **take** **responsibility** for it.
- Leadership involves making constant improvements and corrections over time.
- When thinking about something, don't look at your past self, look at the **present**.
- Don't care about looking foolish. It will happen.
- Help the others.
- **"Empathy is a core engineering value"**
