**Object-oriented programming** is a [Programming Paradigm](/programming-fundamentals/#programming-paradigms) based on the usage of objects.

**Objects** are entities with an internal state associated with certain operations that can manipulate its state. They are organized in an hierarchy of classes, subclasses and instances.

## Inheritance

**Inheritance** is the process of transmitting a class's internal state and its methods to all of its subclasses, except if any of those are explicitly overwritten on the subclass definition.
