So, Tracy in LxJS talked about how to solve conflicts between developers mainly and to be in community. Some key aspects of what she said:

- Words and tone matters. Be careful.
- Try not to commit logical failures.
- Avoid fights and don't mention stupid irrelevant points.
- Try to understand the conflict and suggest resolutions.
- Communicate with the opposition is also key.
