**Capacitance** refers to the ability of a [Capacitor](/capacitor/) to store charge. Represented in Farads, $F = A^2 s^4 kg^{−1} m^{−2}$.

## Parallel Plate Capacitor

The formula for the capacitance of a **parallel plate capacitor** is as follows:

$$C=\epsilon\frac{A}{d}$$

Where:

- $A$ is the area of overlap of the two plates in $m^2$.
- $d$ is the separation between the plates in $m$.
- $\epsilon$ is the permittivity.
