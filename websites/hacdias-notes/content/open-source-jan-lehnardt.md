This talk was a bit different from the previous ones in terms of content. Jan focused more on the political and business side of open-source and what should we do to improve society. Some key aspects:

- Build more **web apps** instead of platform-specific ones.
- Government/public money should be invested on more open source projects, such as Wikipedia, which are accessible to everyone.
- Use both **politics** and **business** to make the world better with open source.

One interesting question he made was: 'why do we all have to pay for our own internet if we could have a more powerful shared internet node paid by all of us?'. I actually think that would be an interesting idea. Internet could be free or, if not, accessible everywhere and paid through taxes. But that would need a good government and good system to make it all work well I think.

He really enjoys JavaScript as he even said 'We are all JavaScript people, the future is ours'.
