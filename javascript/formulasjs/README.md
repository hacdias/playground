#formulas.js#

Formulas.js is just more one file in .js family that groups various math formulas related to algebra and geometry.

It is not a big thing but we want to put more formulas in it when we discover more or when we can apply it with javascript.

You can give a try [here](http://hacdias.github.io/formulasjs/).
