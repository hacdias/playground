> For all the experiments that do not deserve their own repository.

This is an experimental repository that contains things that I have done over the years. Things that may not make sense, or not even work. Feel free to take a look around.

I decided to put them into a single repository, combining the history of many older repositories. The goal is to not pollute my namespace with too many repositories of simple tools and experiments that I created only for myself, but realistically no one else would use them.

If there is anything that you think would be worth moving to its own repository - extremely unlikely -, feel free to reach me out through the repository issues!
