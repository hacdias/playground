#Hello everyone

My name is Henrique Dias and I'm an extremely curious about technology. I want to be a programmer and do something useful for the people. [Read more here.](http://henriquedias.com/)

This repository contains some experiments that I've made and some code that I use in a couple of blogs I write for. So... be free to see.

Right now I have some experiments about a small number of languages but I think that with the time it will being increased.
