# Notes to Hugo

This is just a small package I built to convert my markdown Notes to a Hugo friendly format, inclunding backlinks and a few other informations. It's used to build my digital garden at [notes.hacdias.com](https://github.com/hacdias/notes.hacdias.com). Note that this package is really tailored for my use case.
