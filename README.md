#InMVC

This is an homemade PHP framework that follows the MVC model and it is currently in the kiln. Feel free to help.

This framework comes with an example of how to use it. Firstly, it has a page called "Page" that is a simple static page.

In the other hand, there is a page called "Posts" that lists the rows of "posts.mvc" that are included in the database dump above.
